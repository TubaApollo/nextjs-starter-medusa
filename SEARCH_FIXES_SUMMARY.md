# Search Functionality Fixes - Complete Resolution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Mobile Search Bar Showing on Desktop
**Problem**: The search input on the search page was showing on all screen sizes instead of being mobile-only.

**Solution**: Added `md:hidden` class to restrict the search input to mobile devices only.

```tsx
// Before: Showing on all screen sizes
<div className="mb-4 sm:mb-6">
  <SearchInput />
</div>

// After: Mobile-only
<div className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 md:hidden">
  <SearchInput />
</div>
```

### 2. ✅ Nav Bar Search Only Showing Categories
**Problem**: The navigation bar search was only displaying category results instead of product results.

**Root Cause**: The ProductResults component was wrapped in a nested `<Index>` component, creating a separate search context that wasn't receiving the search query from the main SearchInput component.

**Solution**: Removed the nested `<Index>` wrappers from ProductResults components in both desktop and mobile views.

```tsx
// Before: Nested Index causing isolation
<Index indexName={SEARCH_INDEX_NAME}>
  <Configure hitsPerPage={20} />
  <ProductResults query={query} country={country} max={10} />
</Index>

// After: Direct access to main search context
<Configure hitsPerPage={20} />
<ProductResults query={query} country={country} max={10} />
```

## Technical Details

### Search Architecture
The search functionality uses InstantSearch with the following structure:

1. **Main InstantSearch Context**: Configured with products index (`SEARCH_INDEX_NAME`)
2. **SearchInput Component**: Uses `useSearchBox()` to update the main search query
3. **ProductResults Component**: Uses `useHits()` to get results from the main context
4. **CategoryResults Component**: Uses separate `<Index>` for categories (correct)

### Why the Fix Works
- The main `InstantSearch` component is configured with the products index
- The `SearchInput` component uses `useSearchBox()` which updates the main search context
- The `ProductResults` component now directly accesses the main context via `useHits()`
- Category results remain in their own `<Index>` context as intended

### Files Modified
- `src/modules/search/templates/search-page/index.tsx` - Fixed mobile search visibility
- `src/modules/layout/components/search-wrapper.tsx` - Fixed nested Index issue

## Current Behavior

### Navigation Bar Search (Desktop)
- ✅ Shows both product and category results in dropdown
- ✅ Products appear in left column, categories in right column
- ✅ "Show all results" link navigates to search page

### Search Page
- ✅ Mobile-only search input (hidden on desktop)
- ✅ Results display properly without resets
- ✅ Both products and categories show correctly

### Mobile Search
- ✅ Full-screen overlay with search input
- ✅ Shows categories first, then products
- ✅ Proper navigation to search page

## Testing Verified
- ✅ Nav bar search shows both products and categories
- ✅ Search page mobile input is hidden on desktop
- ✅ Search results persist without resets
- ✅ All search functionality works across devices
- ✅ URL synchronization works correctly

The search functionality is now fully operational with proper product and category results in all contexts.
