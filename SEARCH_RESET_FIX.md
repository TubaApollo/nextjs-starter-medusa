# Search Results Reset Issue - FIXED

## Problem
When users typed in the search input on the dedicated search page, results would show up briefly but then get reset immediately, making the search functionality unusable.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by conflicting state management between two components:

1. **QueryFromUrl component** - Was syncing URL parameters to InstantSearch state
2. **MobileTopSearch component** - Had its own state management and URL syncing

This created a race condition where:
1. User types in search input
2. Results show up briefly from InstantSearch
3. QueryFromUrl component resets the search based on URL
4. MobileTopSearch tries to update URL
5. This creates a loop that continuously resets the results

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Conflicting Component
- ✅ Removed the `QueryFromUrl` component entirely
- ✅ Eliminated the duplicate state management

### 2. Enhanced Search Input Component
- ✅ Renamed `MobileTopSearch` to `SearchInput` for clarity
- ✅ Made it work for both mobile and desktop (was mobile-only before)
- ✅ Improved initialization logic to properly sync with URL on mount
- ✅ Added proper guards to prevent updates during initialization

### 3. Fixed State Management Logic
```typescript
// Before: Conflicting updates
useEffect(() => {
  const urlQuery = searchParams.get('query') || ''
  refine(urlQuery) // This was causing resets
}, [searchParams, refine])

// After: Controlled updates only when user is typing
useEffect(() => {
  if (!initializedRef.current) return // Don't run until initialized
  
  const t = setTimeout(() => {
    if (isTypingRef.current) { // Only update when user is actually typing
      isTypingRef.current = false
      if (value !== query) {
        refine(value)
      }
      // Update URL only when needed
    }
  }, 220)
  return () => clearTimeout(t)
}, [value, country, query, refine, router])
```

### 4. Improved User Experience
- ✅ Added desktop search input (was missing before)
- ✅ Better styling with focus states
- ✅ Proper initialization from URL parameters
- ✅ Debounced input to prevent excessive API calls

## Files Modified
- `src/modules/search/templates/search-page/index.tsx` - Main fix applied here

## How It Works Now
1. **Page Load**: Search input initializes with URL query parameter
2. **User Types**: Input is debounced and updates InstantSearch state
3. **Results Display**: Results show immediately and stay visible
4. **URL Sync**: URL is updated only when user stops typing
5. **No Conflicts**: Single source of truth for search state

## Testing Verified
- ✅ Search input properly initializes from URL
- ✅ Results display and remain visible when typing
- ✅ No more reset loops or flickering
- ✅ Works on both mobile and desktop
- ✅ URL synchronization works correctly
- ✅ Navigation bar search integration still works

The search functionality is now fully operational and provides a smooth user experience without any result resets.
