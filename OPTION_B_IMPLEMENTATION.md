# Option B Implementation: Server-Side JWT Authentication with Client Synchronization

## Overview

This implementation maintains your existing server-side approach with JWT tokens while fixing the authentication synchronization issues between client and server components.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Customer Context** (`src/lib/context/customer-context.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used direct fetch calls with `credentials: "include"`
- **After**: Uses the existing `retrieveCustomer` server action that properly handles JWT cookies
- **Benefit**: Ensures consistent authentication state between client and server

### 2. **Created Auth Event System**
- **File**: `src/lib/util/auth-events.ts` - Utility functions for triggering auth events
- **File**: `src/lib/client/auth.ts` - Client-side wrappers for server actions
- **Benefit**: Synchronizes server-side auth changes with client-side context

### 3. **Added Auth Monitor Component** (`src/lib/components/auth-monitor.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Monitors form submissions and page navigation for auth changes
- **Integration**: Added to root layout to work globally
- **Benefit**: Automatically detects successful login attempts and refreshes auth state

### 4. **Enhanced Wishlist Context** (`src/lib/context/wishlist-context.tsx`)
- **Improved Loading States**: Better handling of customer loading before wishlist operations
- **Auth Error Handling**: Detects 401 errors and triggers auth refresh
- **Event Listeners**: Responds to auth change events to reload wishlist
- **Benefit**: Wishlist stays synchronized with authentication state

### 5. **Updated Login Form** (`src/modules/account/components/login/index.tsx`)
- **Added**: `data-auth-form="login"` attribute for auth monitoring
- **Benefit**: Auth monitor can detect successful login submissions

### 6. **Enhanced Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- **Added**: `AuthMonitor` component for global auth event handling
- **Proper Order**: CustomerProvider → SearchModalProvider → WishlistProvider
- **Benefit**: Ensures auth events are captured throughout the app

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow:
1. **User submits login form** → Server action processes login and sets JWT cookie
2. **AuthMonitor detects form submission** → Triggers `auth-login` event
3. **CustomerContext receives event** → Calls `retrieveCustomer` server action
4. **WishlistContext receives auth change** → Reloads wishlist data
5. **All components** → Automatically update with new auth state

### Error Handling:
1. **Wishlist operation fails with 401** → Triggers `auth-changed` event
2. **CustomerContext refreshes** → Validates current JWT token
3. **If invalid** → Customer state becomes null, UI shows login prompt
4. **If valid** → Maintains auth state, retries operation

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ **Consistency**
- Single source of truth for authentication (JWT cookies)
- Server actions and client context use same auth mechanism
- No more auth state mismatches

### ✅ **Reliability** 
- Automatic error recovery from auth failures
- Proper loading states during auth operations
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

### ✅ **Performance**
- Minimal API calls (only when auth state changes)
- Cached customer data with proper revalidation
- Efficient wishlist loading tied to auth state

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Seamless auth state updates across components
- Proper loading indicators
- Clear error messages for auth issues

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Login** → Wishlist should automatically load
2. **Logout** → Wishlist should clear immediately
3. **Session expiry** → App should detect and prompt for re-login
4. **Network errors** → Should gracefully handle and retry
5. **Multiple tabs** → Auth changes should sync across tabs (with custom events)

## Migration from Previous Implementation

### No Breaking Changes:
- Existing server actions still work as before
- Wishlist API remains the same
- Login/logout flows are unchanged
- Component interfaces are compatible

### Automatic Improvements:
- Better error handling
- Consistent auth state
- Proper loading states
- Auth synchronization

This implementation solves the core issue of authentication inconsistency while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the overall reliability of the wishlist system.
